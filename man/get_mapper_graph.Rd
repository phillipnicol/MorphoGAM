\usage{
get_mapper_graph(
  graph,
  filter_values,
  num_intervals = 10,
  percent_overlap = 33
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An igraph object (n vertices).}

\item{filter_values}{A numeric vector (n) of filter values, specifying how to
order the vertices of the graph and thus group them into level sets.}

\item{num_intervals}{An integer specifying the resolution of the Mapper
algorithm (the number of level sets).}

\item{percent_overlap}{A numeric between 0 and 100 specifying the gain of
Mapper algorithm (the percentage that level sets should overlap).}
}
\value{
igraph object containing the Mapper graph
}
