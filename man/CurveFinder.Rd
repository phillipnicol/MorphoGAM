\title{CurveFinder: Automatically estimate curve in two-dimensional ST data}
\usage{
CurveFinder(xy, knn = 5, prune.outlier = NULL, loop = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{xy}{A numeric matrix or data frame with two columns representing the x and y coordinates of the data points.}

\item{knn}{An integer specifying the number of nearest neighbors used to construct the KNN graph. Default is 5.}

\item{prune.outlier}{A numeric threshold for pruning outliers based on the distance to the k+1 nearest neighbor. Outliers are removed if their distance exceeds `prune.outlier * median(nnk)`. Defaults to NULL (no pruning).}

\item{loop}{A logical value indicating whether the curve should be treated as a loop (closed curve). Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{xyt}{A data frame with x and y coordinates, fitted curve parameters (`t` and `r`), and fitted values for x and y (`f1` abd `f2`).}
\item{curve.plot}{A ggplot object showing the original data with the fitted curve overlaid.}
\item{coordinate.plot}{A ggplot object displaying the data points color-coded by their fitted `t` values.}
\item{residuals.plot}{A ggplot object displaying the data points color-coded by their fitted `r` values.}
}
\description{
This function estimates a (possibly closed) parametric curve
passing through spatial transcriptomics data and uses this curve to define
morphologically relevant coordinates `t` and `r`.
